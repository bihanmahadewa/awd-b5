Changing file and directory permissions

wrx wrx wrx
g   u   o

g - group owner 
u - file owner
o - other users
a - all users

In Numerical representation
	w - 4
	r - 2
	x - 1


Give directory b full permission for all users
    $ sudo chmod -R 777 b 

-R shows recursive. It declares that the permissions should be specifically applied to this folder
and also for the contents inside it.

sudo is super user or the root :)

    $ sudo chmod o+r a
